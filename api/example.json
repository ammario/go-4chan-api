Basically this &quot;A 100% hydration sourdough starter is a culture which is kept and fed with water and flour at equal weights. Like for instance 5 oz water to 5 oz flour. A 166% hydration starter is fed with equal volume of flour and water&#44; which most typically is one cup of water (8.3 oz) and one cup of flour (5 oz).&quot;<br><br>It's important to have the right type of starter for a recipe- if the hydration is wrong you may wind up with an overly wet or dry resulting dough.","time":1346972240,"resto":3856791,"trip":""},{"no":3856919,"now":"09\/06\/12(Thu)18:58","name":"Anonymous","email":"","sub":"","com":"<span class=\"quote\"><a href=\"3856791#p3856913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3856913<\/a><\/span><br>PS- 100% hydration seems the most commonly used starter.","time":1346972305,"resto":3856791,"trip":""},{"no":3856925,"now":"09\/06\/12(Thu)18:59","name":"Anonymous","email":"","sub":"","com":"<span class=\"quote\"><a href=\"3856791#p3856886\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3856886<\/a><\/span><br><br>hydration simply refers to the amount of water proportional to the amount of flour. 100% hydration means a 50\/50 ratio of water to flour by weight. if the water and flour are equal by volume (e.g: a cup of water to a cup of flour) then it is 166% hydration. it generally refers to starter cultures.","time":1346972385,"resto":3856791,"trip":""},{"no":3856926,"now":"09\/06\/12(Thu)18:59","name":"RF360","email":"","sub":"","com":"The Kneading Step<br>Let's assume you don't have a fancy dough hook&#44; though&#44; and you need to knead by hand. That's the case with a lot of hand mixers as they may not have the POWER they need to knead the bread...<br><br>Butter or flour your hands so they won't stick. I recommend using a little bread flour&#44; it's the easy answer&#44; but some people swear by a thin smear of butter. Work the dough with the HEELS of your hands. Push firmly&#44; and pressure it against he work surface. The dough should fold over itself as you work. <br><br>Push the dough away from yourself&#44; shove it and peel it off the surface&#44; reform it into a loose ball&#44; and then give it a quarter turn and shove it some more. Do this about 10 minutes. If you have a scraper it can be handy to keep the dough together at this point.<br><br>Once the dough gets smooth and elastic&#44; you have developed the GLUTEN&#44; and the bread dough is ready to rise. Failing this step means your bread dough won't rise properly (like trying to blow a bubble with unchewed gum it JUST DOESN'T WORK.)<br><br>Here's how you can test for success. Slowly&#44; gently&#44; stretch a little piece of dough&#44; turning it in a circle as you stretch it out. If the dough can form a sheer membrane&#44; thin enough that light comes through it&#44; your bread bubblegum is ready to rock.<br><br>You can also use the thermometer method if you have an instant read. The center of the activated bread will read 79 degrees F when it's perfect.","time":1346972391,"resto":3856791,"trip":"!!s1shuD45usb"},{"no":3856927,"now":"09\/06\/12(Thu)19:00","name":"Anonymous","email":"","sub":"","com":"<span class=\"quote\"><a href=\"3856791#p3856913\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;3856913<\/a><\/span><br><br>huh you answered it for me with almost exactly the same info. i should refresh more.","time":1346972454,"resto":3856791,"trip":""}]}
